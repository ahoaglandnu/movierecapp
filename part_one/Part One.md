### Overview

Here we are going to create a csv file of the released and to-be released 2017 movies. We will pull this information from Wikipedia.

### Setup

#### Launch your virtual environment. 

I used Anaconda and Python 3.6.1. To check your version from the command line, type:

`$ python -V*`

Activate virtual environment:

`$ source activate <name_of_environment>` 

If you have not created a virtual environment before, you can read more here:
